# Data Mapping Access Objects Generator (DMAOG)
DMAOG is a library that allows to use data mapping rules to automatically generate code to access
the data generated from these mapping rules. In this way a developer only has to write the mapping
rules to generate a Knowledge Graph, then DMAOG will apply the mapping rules and generate the data access code 
necessary to query them. Additionally, DMAOG can take care of the data changes—and reapplying mapping rules—as a background task.

# How it works
DMAOG is able to run mapping rules in ShExML and RML. After applying the mapping rules the data is explored through
SPARQL queries in order to get the details of each type. It is important to remark that every desired data object to be
generated must contain a type declaration in the form of `:subject a :type`. From the analysis DMAOG builds a set of
Java classes that compounds the Data Access layer for the data generated by the mapping rules. This layer can be
used in any Java-based project that uses DMAOG as a dependency. When accessing the data, DMAOG relies on reflection
techniques to create and populate the objects that are then returned to the user through the created data access layer.

# How to start
The DMAOG library is composed of two different entry points that are intended for the two steps described earlier: 
code generation and data access. The CLI is intended for the code generation from the command line in an easy and 
consistent way. Data access layer is used by the generated code to effectively encapsulate data query.

As an example we can use the mapping rules hosted in this project under the films.shexml file to generate the data access layer with the following command
(see the CLI section to get further details about the configuration possibilities):
```
$ java -jar dmaog.jar -m films.shexml -o . -p com.herminiogarcia.dmaog
```
This command will create the following files: Actor.java, Film.java, ActorService.java, FilmService.java and DataAccessSingleton.java. 
Inside DataAccessSingleton.java all the configuration parameters can be set up. Then the services can be directly used, for example:
`new FilmService().getAll();` and the methods will return the results encapsulated in the generated DTO objects. To see all the methods supported by the services take a look to the "Supported methos in services" 
section.

# CLI
```
Usage: dmaog [-hV] [-dr=<drivers>] -m=<mappingRules> [-ml=<mappingLanguage>]
    -o=<outputPath> -p=<packageName> [-ps=<password>] [-u=<username>]
Generate data access objects and services from your mapping rules.
    -dr, --drivers=<drivers>
        Drivers string in case it is not included in ShExML
    -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
    -m, --mapping=<mappingRules>
        Path to the file with the mappings
    -ml, --mappingLanguage=<mappingLanguage>
        Mapping language to use: ShExML or RML
    -o, --output=<outputPath>
        Path where to generate the output files
    -p, --package=<packageName>
        Package information for the generated files
    -ps, --password=<password>
        Password in case of database connection
    -u, --username=<username>
        Username in case of database connection
    -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
```

# Supported methods in services
* getAll(): List[Type] -> Returns all the results for the type
* getById(String id): Type -> Return the object with the given id for the type. Take into account that the id is refering
to the local part of the subject URI when talking about RDF data.
* getByField(String fieldName, String value): List<Type> -> Return all the results whose indicated field value matches with
the given value. Take into account that the fieldName refers to the localPart of the predicate URI when talking about RDF data.

# Future work
* Support for Triple Stores and for data modification actions 
* Possibility to use Shapes for code generation
